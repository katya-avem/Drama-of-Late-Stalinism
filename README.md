Late Stalinism is one of the most traumatic periods in the history of Russia, which left a deep imprint on the culture of the 20th century.
This project is dedicated to the interesting part of  Soviet post-war culture - drama of Late Stalinism. The purpose of the project is to study the corpus of the plays that were awarded the Stalin Prize between 1945 and 1953.  
A lexical analysis of the replicas of characters in plays can tell a lot about the main types of characters in these plays, as well as about the goals that were solved by bringing such characters to the stage.
